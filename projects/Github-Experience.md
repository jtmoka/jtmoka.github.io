I used github, In my former classes. I also download gitkraken and FileZilla. I used these to send my code to my teacher.

Github functioned as the primary method of collaboration. In each project, we submitted our code to the teacher with the github website. This was only for one class.

One of the major projects was to use the java language to program a rudimentary Pokemon game. This project requires us to each collaborate with four of our classmates, thrugho Github. I was I a team of five, all of whom communicated using github.
