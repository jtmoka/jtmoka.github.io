I have used Github in my classes. I also downloaded Gitkraken and FileZilla. I used these to send my code to my teachers.

Github functioned as a primary method of collaboration. In projects, we submitted our code useing with the Github website.

One of the major projects was to use the java language to program a rudimentary Pokemon game. This project required us to each collaborate with four of our classmates through Github. I was in a team of five, all of whom communicated using Github.
