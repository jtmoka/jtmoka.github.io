Over the summer, I programmed a game called The Little Homunculus using javascript. This is a basic platformer game, based on former products. The game has an incomplete sequel that I am working on.

The Little Homunculus is a nonlinear platformer. The game has no fail state or computer controlled characters. The system allows for you to control multiple characters, however this game only has the one the player starts with. The follow up game will let the player use four different characters who find and use equipment.

The original game, on which I based my own, is named The Wastelands. This game had the block array system of level construction. I also inherited the collision system from this forerunner. You can access this game from The Little Homunculus. I did add the tiles effects, altering the blocks from being only floors or portals. In place of portal tiles, my game uses the borders of the map as portals to other maps.
