I took a class on computer art my first semester. My second project was to make a poster, for a fake move. The process of this system is very similar to computer programming. I learned how to install and use software, in his class.
 
I wrote the the fake stories for each project. I then designed my art around the story I made. The second project, was meant to be a poster for a time travel, detective, mystery movie poster. 
 
I had two other projects for that class. The first was to draw a picture, using the software. The third was to make a cinematic trailer for a different fake movie. Each project, used different adobe software.
