Myself and three others made a computer application, called "StudyMatches". Jui-Chen Tang, one of my teammates, came up with the Name. Another member of my team, Rex Lactaoen, made the core of the application. I and my cohort, Keanu Lagundimao , made the primary primary systems.

This computer application that allows communication between students. I made the meassge bourd system, that allows studits to post bourds.I also programmed the administrator pages for this page. From the admin page I allows the operator to delete boards and pages.
