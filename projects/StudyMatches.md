Three colleagues and I made a computer application called "StudyMatches". Jui-Chen Tang, one of my teammates, came up with the name. Another member of my team, Rex Lactaoen, made the core of the application. My collaborator, Keanu Lagundimao, and I made the primary peripheral systems.

This computer application allows communication between students. I made the message board system that allows students to post boards. I also programmed the administrator pages. From the admin page, it allows the operator to delete boards and pages.
