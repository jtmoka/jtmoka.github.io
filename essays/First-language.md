Javascript is an intuitive programming language and is easy to use. I have used a variant of javascript before. This class has informed me of modern coding style. This is the most stringent forward language, I know how to use.

I first learned to code using the online instruction website Khan Academy. This site teaches introductory javascript, making that version the first computer language I used. I have never encountered the language in a college course.

I have been using outdated coding since I started using javascript. I was originally taught to use var for most variables. I have also been using arrays and objects in un-optimal ways. FreeCodeCamp taught me about these more efficient coding conventions.

I have learned to code in Java, C, C++ and javascript, javascript being the most simple to use, in my opinion. Java, in comparison, is cumbersome. I think C is similar to javascript on the surface level. I have the least experience using C++. I found it to be unintuitive.
