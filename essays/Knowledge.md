  Coding Under Pressure - Because of the timed in-class programming system, I have learned to code quickly without making mistakes. This is useful both for coding with limited time, and programming more efficiently over all. I can more effectively code, without expending time frivolously.
  
  Team cooperation - The final project for this class required intricate teamwork. I have worked on some simple team-based programming before this class. This project required us to communicate closely so I learn how to coordinate with a group.
  
  User Interface - I have learned to make interactive pages, allowing for better usability. My past programs were not meant to be used by a non programmer, and generally required at least some direct interaction with code. I can now program user friendly programs.
