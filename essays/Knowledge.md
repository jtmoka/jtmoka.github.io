I learn new programming methods from my ISC 314 class. I learned to coding under pressure. Team cooperation was emphasised in the last assignment. This class was the first to teach me to make practical user interface.
 
  Coding Under Pressure - Because of a timed in-class programming system, I have learned to code quickly without making mistakes. This is useful both for coding with limited time, and programming more efficiently over all. I can more effectively code, without expending time frivolously.
  
  Teamwork - The final project for my ISC 314 class required intricate teamwork. I worked on some simple team-based programming before this. This project required us to communicate closely to compete effectively, so I learn how to coordinate with a group.
  
  User Interface - I have learned to make interactive pages, allowing for better usability. My past programs were not meant to be used by non-programmers, and generally required at least some direct interaction with code. I can program now, user friendly programs.
