Asking good questions can make solving the problem much easier. Making imprecise or unfoucest queries can lead to answers that are not focused. Inquiries should be clearly stated, so the question can be discussed without difficulty. A failed answers can add direction to responses.

Ravindra Barthwal’s question titled “Room Database Migration Failed: ALTER TABLE to add multiple columns”, is a well made query. He Clearly states his problem, as well as the roadblock that he has run in to. He also displays his code and error message, allowing his audience to understand first hand. 

M. Usman Khan’S question titled “Adding same marker again after remove() - Android” is, comparatively, unfocused. He provided no refrits to reference to his point of failure. Without a point to start from any responses will be unsatisfactory. The answers given only give advice on how to start, and provide no solutions.
